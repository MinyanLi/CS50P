I am rescently taking [CS50P](https://learning.edx.org/course/course-v1:HarvardX+CS50P+Python/home) ([CS50's Introduction to Programming with Python](https://cs50.harvard.edu/python/2022/)), which is a course from HarvardX. 

I would like to share the solution of the problem sets I have done. They are not the best solutions. If you have better solutions, you are more than welcome to share with me.
