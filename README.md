# Minyan's CS50P(2022) homework

I am rescently taking [CS50P](https://learning.edx.org/course/course-v1:HarvardX+CS50P+Python/home) (CS50's Introduction to Programming with Python), which is a course from HarvardX.

I would like to share the solution of the problem sets I have done. They are not the best solutions. If you have better solutions, you are more than welcome to share with me.

(P.S. Please follow the honor code.)
